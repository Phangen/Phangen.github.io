                                                I wanted to create a real-time puzzle generator which does not use a stored memory of levels and instead loads a new level every time one is needed. I used the generation algorithm as a small part of a larger capstone project. I wanted to reformat the generation to make a smaller project that only shows off the Sokoban level generation.

                                            The project comes equipped with standard menu controls, so just click the play button and a level will begin to be generated. Once the level is loaded you will be able to use WASD or the arrow keys to move the player character. The goal is to push the treasure chest to the red carpet this will generate the next level after a quick animation. Levels will then just continue being generated. How many levels you have completed is recorded in the top left corner. If you ever mess up there is a reset button in the bottom left corner of the screen which will both generate a new level and reset the number of levels, you have solved (This is considered a “loss” in this game).

                                                         This generation is a modified version of the way Joshua Taylor generates these levels in his dissertation <a href="https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc801887/m2/1/high_res_d/dissertation.pdf">THE PROCEDURAL GENERATION OF INTERESTING SOKOBAN LEVELS</a>. We then of course provide visuals for it. The reason for this modification has to do with the objective of real-time generation the times presented for levels generation by the algorithm as presented in Taylor’s dissertation would not work for a realistic loading screen. I thus optimized around 1-box puzzles which a significantly faster to generate than multi-box puzzles. <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        Now time for a long rant on how the levels are generated. We generate the full complete level in the following 3 steps: <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        <div class="col text-center text-lg-start mb-5 mb-lg-0">
                                                            <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-4">
                                                                <div class="text-secondary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-5">Generate the level’s walls and floors</div>
                                                        To generate a level, we divide it into 4 rooms making the whole room a 2x2 square level. 
                                                        Each of the rooms is made up of cells which are the places the player can move into (floors) or places the player cannot move into (walls).  To generate the level out of these rooms we do the following steps: <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        (a)	Randomly select a room template from our internal list of possible rooms. <br>
                                                        (b)	Randomly rotate it. <br>
                                                        (c)	Randomly reflect it. <br> 
                                                        (d)	Pick a random unoccupied location in the level.<br> 
                                                        (e)	Attempt to put the room in the level. <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        We continue doing this process until a number of failed placements are reached or we have filled the level with rooms.
                                                            </div>
                                                        </div>
                                                        <br>
                                                        <div class="col text-center text-lg-start mb-5 mb-lg-0">
                                                            <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-4">
                                                                <div class="text-secondary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-5">Place Boxes and goals</div>
                                                        We now want to place the objects that we need in our room down, so we take our generated level and for every potential place a goal could be placed we essentially perform iterative deepening to figure out the furthest possible number of moves of a box. <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        We then take the best possible set of levels generated and pick one at random to be our level we send to the output step. <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        (Originally the algorithm also searched for the best player starting position as well, but I cut that out for the sake of generating a level faster.)

                                                                This is the simplest step we just parse through the level placing 2D objects corresponding to the walls, the goal, the player and the box where needed.

                                            In the coding of the Sokoban puzzle I learned a lot about the debugging of complex graphical programs. I ran into a variety of issues and had to develop methods of testing the in Sokoban in the various stages of writing the code from the visual output, to its on text-based output. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            I also applied a lot of what I learned very early into my software development education of creating custom data structures and ways to hold various information as I had to develop a way for various pieces of the Sokoban level to come together. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            I also learned about Unity 2D as this was my first experience with it and working with 2D sprites and Tile maps instead of 3D objects.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Finally, I worked a lot on improving the structure of the developed game which allowed for a better formatted back-end structure with additive scenes for various menus and gameplay elements than my previous collaborative work.
