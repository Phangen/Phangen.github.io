                                Using X, Y and Z coordinates we can create vertices which can be connected via designated triangles. 
                                These vertices and polygons result in our final image. 
                            </project-body-dark>

                                The scene above uses the basic calculations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_lighting#:~:text=look.%5B9%5D-,Lighting%20interactions,-%5Bedit%5D">Diffuse, Ambient, and Specular lighting</a>. 
                                This results in a primitive implementation of the way lighting works in real life. 
                                To achieve this, we have a light source represented by a little white sphere. 
                                Then based on the location of this one light source we can change the color of various fragments of our model to end up with our final lit model.

                                The whole model moves on a Parametric equation that is essentially just a parabola that goes back and forth to emulate what I would describe as a levitating bounciness. 
                                The magnets just rotate. 
                                Together this shows the hierarchical transformations as the whole model is moving the magnets have two layers of transformations applied to them.

                                which we use to both create a skybox and map reflections onto on object as described in the linked Wikipedia page. 
                                This is one of the many ways to emulate sky and reflections as discovered by artists and computer scientists and while being one of the simplest of them computationally still ends up with a good reflection effect on single objects like our above scene.

                            This was an accumulation of all the WebGL knowledge I learned over a semester of learning. 
                            This project proved I could do a lot more complicated 3D model manipulation and animation than I thought I was capable of at the start of the semester. I went from drawing colored squares, to drawing 3D primitives, and finally finished off with a fully rendered scene with animation.
