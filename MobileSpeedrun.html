                                    I saw a mobile game on the Google Play Store that frustrated me to point that I had to talk about it. One of my first thoughts was that I could make the game and make it fast. I thus wanted to time my process to see how quick I could replicate the game's core mechanics.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Additionally, I wanted to use this experience to critique some aspect of game design which I do not enjoy as a player. This longer review has been put on hiatus.

                                Because this is a mobile application not available for download on the Google Play Store, please contact me if you have any desire to download and play the game.
                                <br><br>
                                The project comes equipped with standard menu controls, so just press the play button and you will be put into the runner game. The goal is to move the player “circle” left and right to collect green and white square collectibles while avoiding the black “bombs”. The player the gains an amount of money which is added to their total after their run based on their performance. The money can then be spent on 2 upgrades which improve the amount of money a player can gain on subsequent runs.
                                <br><br>
                                Here is some extended game play below, so you can get the idea of how game works without play:

                                These are the features I wanted in the project to complete my “speedrun”, all of which are key features in the game I was replicating:
                                <br><br>
                                <project-body-dark>
                                    <div class="text-primary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-4">Player Movement</div>
                                    The player moves along a “track” where they only control left and right movement not vertical/forward movement.
                                </project-body-dark>
                                <br>
                                <project-body-dark>
                                    <div class="text-primary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-4">Depth lines</div>
                                    Lines that indicate how far down the player is and indicate progress/ give context to the player’s movement along the “track”.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This also means that they are used to indicate when the games are over if the player gets to the depth of 0.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I also decided to use these lines to spawn new collectible game objects.
                                </project-body-dark>
                                <br>
                                <project-body-dark>
                                    <div class="text-primary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-4">Collectibles</div>
                                    Game objects which move left to right with a speed within a random range of reasonable speeds.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We have 3 types of collectibles:
                                    <br><br>
                                    <project-body-bright>
                                        <div class="text-secondary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-5">Standard</div>
                                        White collectibles which give an amount of money equal to the depth that the collectible is collected.
                                    </project-body-bright>
                                    <br>
                                    <project-body-bright>
                                        <div class="text-secondary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-5">Bombs</div>
                                        Black collectables that when hit end the players current run and cause the player to lose approximately half of the collectibles they have collected randomly.
                                    </project-body-bright>
                                    <br>

                                        <div class="text-secondary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-5">Treasure</div>
                                        Green collectables that give double money equal to double the depth value meaning they are the most valuable collectables to collect.
                                    </project-body-bright>
                                </project-body-dark>

                                    <div class="text-primary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-4">Progression</div>
                                    The player may spend money earned during the game on two upgrades which increase the amount of money the player can gain on further runs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <project-body-bright>
                                        <div class="text-secondary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-5">Captures</div>
                                        The player can only catch a certain number of collectibles per play, so the player can purchase more capacity.
                                    </project-body-bright>
                                    <br>
                                    <project-body-bright>
                                        <div class="text-secondary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-5">Depth</div>
                                        The player can buy depth upgrades to increase the depth they start at which subsequently makes the positive collectibles (not bombs) more valuable as you encounter them with higher money values.
                                    </project-body-bright>
                                    <br>
                                    After a purchase the subsequent purchase of that same upgrade will be higher by about 20% of the original purchase cost. This steep increase simulates the increased value gained from more and more upgrades.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Note: The original game allowed you to additionally by “income” which is generated up to a certain amount when the player is offline not playing which because this an aspect, I wanted to criticize was not include in my creation process.
                                </project-body-dark>
                                <br>

                                    <div class="text-primary fw-bolder mb-2 fs-4">Animations</div>
                                    While not necessary for my game to have all the mechanics of the original, to both make it easier to see collisions with collectables and to make the game more understandable various animations were included. These include the following:
                                    <br><br>
                                    <project-body-bright>

                                        When the player collides with a postivee collectable, the amount of money the collectable is worth is shown.
                                    </project-body-bright>

                                        When the player coliides with a bomb, The amount of money the player lost via the bomb is to shown via negative numbers.

                                        When the player finishes a run and returns to the main menu, the amount of money the player gained total is shown breftly below their total money.

                            <project-body-main>
                                In the coding of the Sokoban puzzle I learned a lot about the debugging of complex graphical programs. I ran into a variety of issues and had to develop methods of testing the in Sokoban in the various stages of writing the code from the visual output, to its on text-based output. <br>
                                <br>
                                I also applied a lot of what I learned very early into my software development education of creating custom data structures and ways to hold various information as I had to develop a way for various pieces of the Sokoban level to come together. <br>
                                <br>
                                I also learned about Unity 2D as this was my first experience with it and working with 2D sprites and Tile maps instead of 3D objects.<br>
                                <br>
                                Finally, I worked a lot on improving the structure of the developed game which allowed for a better formatted back-end structure with additive scenes for various menus and gameplay elements than my previous collaborative work.
