                                                I saw a mobile game on the Google Play Store that frustrated me to point that I had to talk about it. One of my first thoughts was that I could make the game and make it fast. I thus wanted to time my process to see how quick I could replicate the game's core mechanics.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Additionally, I wanted to use this experience to critique some aspect of game design which I do not enjoy as a player. This longer review has been put on hiatus.

                                            The project comes equipped with standard menu controls, so just press the play button and you will be put into the runner game. The goal is to move the player “circle” left and right to collect green and white square collectibles while avoiding the black “bombs”. The player the gains an amount of money which is added to their total after their run based on their performance. The money can then be spent on 2 upgrades which improve the amount of money a player can gain on subsequent runs.

                                                            The player moves along a “track” where they only control left and right movement not vertical/forward movement.

                                                            This also means that they are used to indicate when the games are over if the player gets to the depth of 0.

                                                            I also decided to use these lines to spawn new collectible game objects.

                                            In the coding of the Sokoban puzzle I learned a lot about the debugging of complex graphical programs. I ran into a variety of issues and had to develop methods of testing the in Sokoban in the various stages of writing the code from the visual output, to its on text-based output. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            I also applied a lot of what I learned very early into my software development education of creating custom data structures and ways to hold various information as I had to develop a way for various pieces of the Sokoban level to come together. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            I also learned about Unity 2D as this was my first experience with it and working with 2D sprites and Tile maps instead of 3D objects.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Finally, I worked a lot on improving the structure of the developed game which allowed for a better formatted back-end structure with additive scenes for various menus and gameplay elements than my previous collaborative work.
